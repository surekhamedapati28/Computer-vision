 Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes, which leads to complete blindness or loss of vision if not
 treated on time. DR requires transfer learning techniques because of the difficulty in getting large, labelled datasets owing
 to privacy concerns and high costs of annotation instead pretrained models on large datasets that are used for better
 performance on smaller, task specific datasets like DeepDRiD which was used in this project.In this project transfer
 learning,different attention mechanisms and ensemble methods are applied on DeepDRiD to achieve robust classification
 performance.
